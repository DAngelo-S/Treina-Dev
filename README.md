# Treina Dev

Here will be my exercises for Treina-Dev, an online course about web development in Ruby.

First, I'll keep here the exercises I had to do for the selective process that I'm current enrolled.

Next, I pretend to keep my projects for the course.

The aim of this course, is to prepare the student for the job market.

## Selective Process

### **Using Git**:  
* Configure and learn how to use git and commit and example file.
* File: [git-example](git-example)
