# Treina Dev

Here I'll keep my exercises for TreinaDev, an online course about web development in Ruby.

First, I'll keep here the exercises I had to do for the selective process that I'm current enrolled.

Next, I pretend to keep my projects for the course.

The aim of this course is to prepare the student for the job market.
