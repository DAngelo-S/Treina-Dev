# Treina Dev

Here I'll keep my exercises for TreinaDev, an online course about web development in Ruby.

First, I'll keep here the exercises I had to do for the selective process that I'm current enrolled.

Next, I pretend to keep my projects for the course.

The aim of this course is to prepare the student for the job market.

## Selective Process

### **Using Git**:  
* Configure and learn how to use git and commit an example file.
    * File: [git-example](git-example)

### **Ruby Fundamentals**
* Create an simple calculator that sums, subtracts, multiply and divides two numbers.
    * File: [calculator](calculator)

* Return a data of an specific data type
    * File: [data-types](data-types)

* Count how many vowels and consonants there are in a phrase.
    * File: [count-vowels-consonants](count-vowels-consonants)
